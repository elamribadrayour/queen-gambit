# ♟️ Chess Evolution Simulator

Welcome to the **Chess Evolution Simulator**. This project simulates the evolution of chess strategies using a genetic algorithm approach to solve the classic N-Queens Problem. It visualizes the process of selection and mutation in a chessboard environment.

## 📚 Overview

The **Chess Evolution Simulator** demonstrates the principles of genetic algorithms through a chessboard simulation. It uses the `nannou` framework for graphical representation and `rand` for randomness in genetic operations. The project illustrates how queens on a chessboard can evolve over iterations to optimize their positions based on fitness evaluations, aiming to solve the N-Queens Problem.

## 🌟 Features

- **Chessboard Visualization**: Displays the chessboard and updates it in real-time with each iteration.
- **Genetic Algorithm Operations**: Implements crossover and mutation to evolve queen positions towards a solution of the N-Queens Problem.
- **Performance Metrics**: Outputs statistics such as best, worst, and average scores over iterations.
